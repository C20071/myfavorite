She also appears in Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard.The series I just metioned are some of favorite series, and Annabeth is my favorite character in them. Annabeth is my favorite character becuase is a Daughter of Athena(Greek goddess of wisdom, war, and arts & crafts). I also like how fierce and smart she is. She is also very loyal, and doesn't give up easily. </p>

    <p>Reading is one of the first hobbies I ever had. I feel like when you read you can travel to a diffrent world, and temporarily forget about your problems. Reading can also sometimes teach about how to deal with things in real life. Also, reading can help you improve your vocabulary, and grades. </p>

    <p>Science fiction and fantasy are my favorite genres in almost everything. Most of the books I read are science fiction and/or fantasy. I also like to wacth fantasy and/or science fiction movies. I also like science fiction/fantasy themed music videos. They are my favorite genres becuase they tend to have more exciting plots thant other genres, and they require more imagination. They are also more  aesthetically pleasing to me. I couldn't pick betweeen these two genres because they are both very similar. </p>

  <h1 id="Groups"class="4">My Favorite K-pop Groups <br> BLACKPINK & BTS</h1>
 <img id="kpop"src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i9qpZXw6ZofwToizU7u9qFn-K-13S66_CvAidTTJIPkbLdOZc1DKuUXc2ATGYN1sqceASCoNN8eaoGd1WcP8lwoS1Xq1EVEoJw=w1200-h630-rj-pp-e365" alt="">
  <p>BTS and BLACKPINK are the biggest K-pop groups right now. They have opened many doors for other K-pop artists. I like how diverse BTS' discography is, and I really like BLACKPINK's style of music. I also like how close the members in the groups are. They also have very good personalities, they are very humble, hard-working and kind. They are also very funny and quirky. Although they tend to be goofy sometimes, they are very professional when they need to be.BTS debuted in 2013, BLACKPINK debuted in 2016.</p>

    <img id="j"src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/330541385/original.jpg">
    <p>Kim Jisoo debuted the girl group BLACKPINK in August, 2016 as the Main Visual and Lead Vocalist. She is 25 years old(korean age). Jisoo is one of the most down to earth and unproblematic k-pop idols ever. She is also very talented, she can sing, dance, rap, and act(Her first lead role will be in the drama Snowdrop by JTBC, which is coming on March 2021). She also has a very caring and kind personality. As the oldest of her group, she always takes care of them, event thought she is the youngest in her family. She also rarely cries, because she feels like she has to stay strong for her members. Also Caroline Suh, the director for BLACKPINK's documentery, said that "she steps back in order to let others shine". Teddy Park, the producer for BLACKPINK, also said that he's known Jisoo for six years, but has only seen her cry twice.</p>
